excerpt: Hey! I’m Tim MacDonald, a local software developer based in regional New South Wales, Australia in the Riverina (Wagga Wagga).

For several years I ran a corporate web development business, but in the last 12 months I’ve broken out of the world of corporate website development using platforms like WordPress and have embraced frameworks like Laravel to produce web based apps. I also enjoy writing native iOS and Android apps that interact with the web apps I build.

Having never blogged and not having a large developer community to be apart of, I’ve decided to jump into the blogging world and have also started a local developer Meetup for the Riverina…we’ll see how they both pan out! Wish me luck, I’ll need it!

My articles are just general musings of things I’ve stumbled upon along the way through my learning and exploration of the Laravel framework, PHP, and any front-end / iOS / Android goodies I manage to get my hands on / head around.

I’m currently working with the [Wiradjuri Condobolin Corporation](http://wiradjuricondocorp.com) on their language revitalisation program, building software to help preserve and maintain Indigenous languages throughout Australia.
